Introduction:
For up to 7+ years, I have been a school teacher. I like teaching and I am proud of myself as someone who is educating the society. As a school, teaching is not the only thing I am responsible for. Yes, it is my main responsibility at the school but assessing the students' performance is another responsibility. The assessment is by testing their academic performance through asking questions in classes, continuous assessments tests, and terminal examinations. One of the most difficult things I face in my teaching career is processing the students' examination results. It takes time! In fact, it takes a couple of days to finish especially if the number of students is much. Sometimes, errors do occur, for example, when calculating the total marks of the subjects or average. With the experience I have from my study at ALX, I decided to develop a project that will help to reduce the cumbersome nature of students' examination result processing. But why not Microsoft Excel? Yes, can be another way to reduce the workload. But the current project I am working has some important features, which to my knowledge, Microsoft Excel does not provide. The application I am developing will allow the user the download a well-designed result of the students with a table consisting of the subjects, their scores as well as their grades, the total score, average.
