About:

This project is an application that serves as a tool for processing students' examination results. But why this
application? One may say that Microsoft Excel can be used for similar task. Yes, but this application has some
features that Microsoft Excel does not provide. I am a school teacher and I know how cumbersome it is to process
students results. One has to sit for several hours with a calculator and sometimes it takes days to complete. This 
application, if completed, will solve the problem and will give the user the option to download the complete result
containing the school logo, the school name, the student information, the subjects as well as their scores and 
their grades, and so on.
The application is still under development. At least 80% of the development is complete.
