                I am currently working on a result processing project application. The application, 
                if completed successfully, will help school teachers to process the results of their students.
                Furthermore, the result can be downloaded as a PDF file with the file name as the name of
                of the student.</p>

                Did you see the screenshot up there? It was taken from one the sections in the application. As you
                can see, the section contains the names of the subjects selected along with number fields. (Only numbers are allowed in the fields.)
                The number fields are created automatically depending on the number of subjects selected.

                The screenshot above shows the sample of the result. After the all the scores are entered, the application
                will calculate the total of the scores and the average, and then creates a table which shows them. 
                The grades shown in the tables are obtained by
                comparing the score of each subject with some certain range. The final result is a table containing 
                selected subjects, their scores and their grades, the total mark, the average, as well as some basic information
                as seen in the screenshot.

                All applications are built with the intension solve some problems and are expected to solve the problem
                when completed. There many schools around the world. Each school carry out terminal examinations and
                the results of the students needs to be processed. I have been a school teacher for some years and one of
                the difficult things I face as well as my colleagues is processing students' examination results. It takes
                time especially if the number of students are much. We have to sit with calculators computing the examination
                scores and the examination average. Due to the cumbersome nature of the work, some unnoticed errors may occur
                during the processing. Therefore, proofreading becomes necessary to correct the error(s) made. With the skills
                I obtained from Holberton School, the application I am currently working will automate all the calculations.
                The few things the user has to do are to enter the student's name, the student's class, the examination term,
                select the subjects offered, enter the score for each subject, and finally download the result as a PDF
                document which will be saved with the student's name. Furthermore, this is my portfolio for Holberton School.
